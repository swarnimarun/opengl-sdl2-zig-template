# zig opengl sdl2 template project

The goal of the project is to be a minimal starter template for me to start and test out opengl projects in Zig.

## known issues

- no linux support (I was working on windows when I wrote this, will fix linux support issue at some point)

## roadmap

none. the project is almost complete, I might add cleanup, more options and update it for newer Zig versions when I have time that's about it.

Still let me know if I am missing any crucial features. I will see if it fits into this template project.
